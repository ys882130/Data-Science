<h5> This R script has been written for the following purpose </h5>

<ul>
<li>Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracting only the measurements for the mean and standard deviation for each measurement</li>
<li>Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>Creating independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ul>

<h5> Code Book </h5>
The description of various variables is as follows : -
<ul>
<li> merge_data = The data set obtained by combining the test and training dataset</li>
<li> mean_and_sd_data = Data set containing only the measurements of mean and standard deviation</li>
<li> descriptive_name = Data set with coloumn names described by the activities</li>
<li> data_with_labels = Data set with self descriptive variable names</li>
<li> averages = Data set with average value of data segregated by activity and subject</li>
<li> The names of remaining variables are self explanatory</li>

</ul>
